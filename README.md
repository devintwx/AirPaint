# AirPaint
AirPaint is a computer vision project that lets you draw using hand gestures. Built with OpenCV and MediaPipe, it tracks your hand movements to simulate basic paintingâ€”like MS Paint, but without a mouse.

#About
AirPaint transforms your webcam into an interactive digital canvas, allowing you to create art using just your hand gestures in the air. The application uses:

- MediaPipe for real-time hand tracking and gesture recognition
- OpenCV for image processing and drawing operations
- Computer Vision techniques to interpret hand movements as drawing commands

The project demonstrates how computer vision can be used to create natural human-computer interfaces, enabling creative expression without physical input devices.
